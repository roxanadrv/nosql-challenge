# nosql-challenge 
# This repository contains materials for a NoSQL challenge, focusing on MongoDB for data storage and analysis. The challenge is split into two main parts: setup and analysis, each provided in Jupyter Notebook format.

## Repository Structure
NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook to guide users through the initial setup of the MongoDB database,       including importing data and basic database operations.

NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the MongoDB        dataset. It includes various queries and aggregation pipelines to extract insights from the data.

resources/: A folder containing necessary data files for the challenge.
    establishments.json: The JSON file used for importing data into the MongoDB database.

    
## Getting Started
To get started with this challenge, you will need to have MongoDB installed and running on your system. The notebooks are designed to be self-contained guides for both setting up the database and performing the analysis.

## Prerequisites
    MongoDB
    Python 3.x
